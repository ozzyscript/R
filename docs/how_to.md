# Quick guide to how do...


## Text selection 

- `fist + fist` to double click, when the word is highlighted,
use `two_up` + `one`, `two_up`, `three`, `four` to expend.
- `like + palm` to select all

Note:
Selecting text up/down might not work well, on a browser "brave" and "nvim" (my case)
so it's recommended to use left/right keys

For nvim enter visual mode using `stop_inverted + like` for letter `v`,
then use normal arrow keys `ok` + `one`, `two_up`, `three`, `four` 
or use numbers `see numbers.md` + up/down keys for faster selection. 

Worth to mention:
I have not tested on every app on my system, so things might be different for you.
